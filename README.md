## EXPERIENCE

### ATMECS | Intern – AI Engineer  
May 2024 – Jul 2024

- Architected multi-agent RAG system using LlamaIndex and LangChain for document analysis, achieving 85% query accuracy on complex financial documents with minimal hallucinations.
- Deployed RAG system via NVIDIA NIM microservices, reducing inference latency by 35% and enabling real-time document processing at scale.
- Built CrewAI multi-agent system for financial risk analysis, improving prediction accuracy by 20% and enabling autonomous decision-making across 100+ financial documents daily.

### CEPOCH | Intern – ML Engineer  
Jan 2024 – Mar 2024

- Built custom dataset of 5,000+ annotated images using Roboflow for bounding-box annotation and strategic data augmentation (rotation, brightness, scale), improving rare-item precision by 15% and reducing manual curation workload by 25%.
- Trained and deployed YOLO model (80% accuracy) on Roboflow-processed dataset for real-time artifact identification, optimizing inference pipeline to eliminate cataloging bottlenecks.
- Integrated YOLO solution into production workflows with automated verification checks, delivering 30% efficiency gains and reducing misclassification errors by 20%.

### SATRA | Intern – ML Engineer  
Oct 2023 – Dec 2023

- Developed U-Net–based pixel-level crack segmentation model in PyTorch with class-weighted loss and data stratification, achieving 80% detection accuracy on holdout data and improving data integrity 15% via automated QC/deduping.
- Optimized end-to-end ML data pipelines by refactoring SQL queries with batch processing and vectorizing Python preprocessing with NumPy, reducing processing time by 40%.
- Built interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize model predictions and risk-severity patterns, enabling engineering teams to reduce manual triage time by 70%.

## PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

### Multi-Adapter LLM System for Specialized Task Routing

- Fine-tuned Mistral-7B with QLoRA to create three task-specific adapters (legal summarization, financial sentiment analysis, Python code generation), reducing memory footprint by 75% and enabling efficient multi-task inference on resource-constrained devices.
- Engineered intelligent adapter routing with task-classification logic to dynamically select the optimal LoRA adapter in real time, reducing inference latency by 40% vs. a single-model baseline.
- Deployed interactive Gradio demo enabling seamless task switching without model reloading for legal, financial, and code tasks.
